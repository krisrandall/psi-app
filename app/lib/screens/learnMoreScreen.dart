This app is designed to be fun to use, but it can also be used to test for psi effects.
It is inspired by the belief that scientific inquiry should be driven by genuine curiosity to explore this incredible and mysterious world in which we find ourselves, and should not be hampered by fears of discovering that we may know less than we assume about what is really going on.
