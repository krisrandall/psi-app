The psychic connectedness app is a Flutter mobile app which allows friends to test their telepathic abilities.

A "sender" stares at an image and the "receiver" needs to pick from a list of 4 possible images which one the sender is looking at and thinking of.

~~The backend is Firebase (`/functions`).~~ **NOT USED**

The [frontend](./app/README.md) is Flutter (`/app`).
